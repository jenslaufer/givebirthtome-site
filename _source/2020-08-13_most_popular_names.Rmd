You know the situation you to talk strangers about it this and that. At some point they ask you how you make your living.
This happened exactly to me last weekend, when I was on u party of a friend. I told the people at the buffet about my website. They were espcially
interested in my babyname database, as they all had kids. Everyone had an anecdote to tell about their name search. Then a woman asked me what
are actually the most popular names, obviously she wanted to test me. It was a bit embarrassing, because I didn't know the answer. I told her that it is "Emma" for girls and "David" for boys. Actually I wasn't sure at all if I was right. I told the people that it's not so easy to answer the question, as it depends on how you define "most popular".

Last Monday I defined different criteria for "most popular" to analyse afterwards our database. In this article I want to show you the interesting results.

## The Alltime Most Popular Names Ranking

In this analysis I evaluated all years since 1880. The analysis is a bit unfair for modern names as over a 100 years ago there were much less names around. 
However the result is still interesting since you can call the names in this ranking "tradional" or "evergreen" names.

## The Most Popular Modern Names

Many people tend to choose a modern name. For them "The Alltime Most Popular Names Ranking" does not provide so much so information. Therefore I created a list with
the most popular names in the last 10 years. The results look different although you can still spot names, that are in the ranking from before.

## The Most Popular Short Modern Names

People often tell me that they prefer short names. For these people is this ranking with modern short names. 


## The Most Popular Long Modern Names

But what's about longer names? I am sure there are people that dislike all these short names like "Zoe" or "Mia"
