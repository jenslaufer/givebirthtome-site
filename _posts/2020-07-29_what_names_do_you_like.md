# What babynames do you like?

Let me guess? I think you like a name for girls, that starts with an 'a', 's' and 'm'. In case of boys names you prefer names 'j', 'a' or 'd' at the beginning. The names you like are about 6 characters long. Could it be that you like names like William, Ava, Liam, Isabella and Logan?

Maybe I am completely wrong, but chances are high that my predictions are correct. Otherwise you are outlier with your name perference. You ask where I know that?

The other day we did an analyis on our names database with over 100,000 names. It holds 107,973 names to be exact. In this article I want to present you our findings.

## Unique names

Is it a nightmare for you, that your kid is one of the children with the same name in class, because the name is so common? Some parents don't have a problem with it, but most do have.
